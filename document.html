            <h2>HTML </h2>
            <p>(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure
                of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation
                (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
                either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading
                content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant
                in the World Wide Web.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>HTML ELEMENTS</h2>
            <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes
                special "elements" such as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside,
                audio, canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, output, progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others. An HTML
                element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded
                by tags. The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase,
                lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h2>HTML IMAGES</h2>
            <p>In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before
                the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. There
                are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble img element, used to
                embed a simple image in a webpage. What exactly should you write inside your alt attribute? It depends on
                why the image is there in the first place. In other words, what you lose if your image doesn't show up:
                <ul>
                    <li>Decoration. You should use CSS background images for decorative images, but if you must use HTML, add
                        a blank alt="". If the image isn't part of the content, a screen reader shouldn't waste time reading
                        it.</li>
                    <li>Content. If your image provides significant information, provide the same information in a brief alt
                        text – or even better, in the main text which everybody can see. Don't write redundant alt text.
                        How annoying would it be for a sighted user if all paragraphs were written twice in the main content?
                        If the image is described adequately by the main text body, you can just use alt="".</li>
                    <li>Link. If you put an image inside a tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide accessible
                        link text. In such cases you may, either, write it inside the same a element, or inside the image's
                        alt attribute – whichever works best in your case.</li>
                    <li>Text. You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, for example,
                        use CSS for that rather than putting the text into an image. However, If you really can't avoid doing
                        this, you should supply the text inside the alt attribute.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984), commonly known as AB de Villiers,
                <b>Mr. 360°</b> or simply AB, is a South African cricketer.
                <b>He is considered as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.</b> He plays for Tshwane Spartans in Mzansi
                Super League and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League. In limited overs cricket he is
                an attacking batsman.He was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international
                career. His name was also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019.

                De Villiers began his international career as
                <i>a wicket-keeper-batsman</i>, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions
                in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive
                batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the
                wicket-keeper.
